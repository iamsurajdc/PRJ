                            There was once a crow who did not like his feathers. “I wish I were a peacock!” He would
                            say.
                            “You are beautiful as you are!” The other crows insisted. “How plain

                            of the
                            crow, some of the peacock feathers lay on the ground when the peacocks left. The crow flew

                            stuck the feathers into his wings and tail. He attached a few
