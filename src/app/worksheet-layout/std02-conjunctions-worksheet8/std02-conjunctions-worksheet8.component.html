						<span>It was a fine summer’s day and fox was out for a stroll</span>
						<span class="input-span">
							<input type="text">
              <span class="answer">when</span>
						</span>
						<span> he spotted a 
							crow sitting on a high branch of a tree. The fox couldn’t help but notice that the crow 
							had in his beak a very large chunk of cheese! The fox being a crafty fox, </span>
						<span class="input-span">
							<input type="text">
              <span class="answer">and</span>
						</span>
						<span> the fact that he’d  not yet had his breakfast, decide that this was too good an 
							opportunity to miss, and sat down at the foot of the tree. He watched the crow </span>
						<span class="input-span">
							<input type="text">
              <span class="answer">as</span>
						</span>
						<span> he thought to come up with a ruse which would deliver the cheese to him. 
							The crow eyed him suspiciously, being very much aware of the fox’s reputation. </span>
						<span class="input-span">
							<input type="text" class="uppercase">
						</span>
						<span class="answer">But</span>
						<span> she considered herself quite safe</span>

								<input type="text">
                <span class="answer">as</span>
							</span>
							<span> it is well known that

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“My! My!” Said the fox at last, looking up towards the crow, “What a magnificent 
							noble bird I see before me! Your beauty is indeed without equal, mistress, and 
							the effect of the sunlight on your feathers is surely beyond compare! I heard from
							my friends that it is your voice, however, that is your finest attribute, and I have 
							been longing to hear you sing!”
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now the crow had never really given much thought to the quality of her voice,</span>
						<span class="input-span">
							<input type="text">
              <span class="answer">but</span>
						</span>
						<span> she was mightily flattered by the fox’s compliments. As a result she 
							forgot all about her suspicions, and threw caution to the wind. She opened her mouth,</span>
						<span class="input-span">
							<input type="text">
              <span class="answer">and</span>
						</span>
						<span> started singing a tune, as loudly as she could, “caw craw craw!”
							As soon as she did so, of course, down fell the cheese, and the fox put his paw 
							over it. “Well, mistress, you do indeed have a fine voice,” he called out to her,
							“</span>
