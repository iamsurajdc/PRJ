                            Once upon a time, there was a poor boy named Aladdin who lived with his mother. One day, a rich stranger came 
                            to their house looking for Aladdin. “I am a merchant,” he told Aladdin’s mother. “I have come all the way from Arabia. 
                            I want to take your boy with me for a little work,

                            I will pay him so much that you will not be poor anymore.”

                            Aladdin's mother soon agreed

                            the man who said he was a merchant, was actually a magician.

                            The next day, Aladdin packed his things and left with the merchant. They traveled for many hours,

                            there was nothing or 
                            no one anywhere. The merchant took out some coloured powder from his pocket. Then, he threw it at the ground

                            the next moment there was smoke all around. As the smoke cleared away, Aladdin saw a big 
                            opening in the ground, like a cave. The merchant asked Aladdin to go inside the cave. “You will 
                            see lots gold inside, more than you will ever see in your life. Take as much as you want. Inside 
                            the cave, you will also see an old lamp. Just get it out for me.”	Aladdin became suspicious,
